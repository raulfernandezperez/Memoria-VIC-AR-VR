This project aims to design, develop and deploy a virtual personal trainer by capturing motion using virtual reality and augmented reality technology.
With the aim of understanding and addressing this project in a correct way, we have reviewed different technologies on the market for the development of a system capable of capturing movements in real time. The advantages that have led to the use of VR devices have been exposed, mentioning different previous studies with satisfactory results. In addition, the novelties that the different existing solutions in dance, personal trainers or martial arts provide in the field of reactive virtual trainers (RVT) were detailed.
This project presents a system for the personal training of a Brazilian martial art (capoeira), which is defined as a mix between dance and fighting sports. The environment developed is designed so that the student can practice and perfect different movements on capoeira without the need for a teacher to review their movements.
To carry out the training, it is necessary to imitate a series of movements previously recorded by experts in the martial art. So that the student can advance in the realization of the movements, there are different levels of training where the student is learning in a progressive way.
The system is capable of being easily adapted for, for example, sports medicine or the rehabilitation of a damaged body part.
After the study, it was possible to observe that the operation of the applications is immersive, intuitive and fast, offering a wide system for 
determine in a visual way which are the movements executed in a wrong way. For all these reasons, it can be said that this type of system is the present and future for learning in different disciplines.
